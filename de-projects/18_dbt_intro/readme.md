# DBT Fundamentals

## Prerequisites

1. GitHub
  1.1 Account
  1.2 New Repo
  1.3 Codespace
2. CLI
3. Docker Desktop

## GitHub

1. Register in GitHub if you don't have an account
2. Create new Repo `dbt_workshop` with empty `README.md`
3. Get the command to clone it `git clone https://github.com/dimoobraznii1986/dbt_workshop.git`

## Cloud Database

1. Register in cloud if you aren't
2. Create a Postgres DB
3. Add Public IP
4. Connect with SQL client (Dbeaver) using credentials
5. Create schemas and tables `de-projects/18_dbt_intro/src/sql/01_create_schemas_tables.sql`
6. Insert data into new tables `de-projects/18_dbt_intro/src/sql/02_insert_data.sql`


## Start project in VSCode

On Windows [install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win). It will add Git Bash that works great for us.
Also, make sure you have Python at the laptop.

On MacOS it exists already.

Create new folder `github` and open it in CLI.

Run the command to clone your new project `git clone https://github.com/dimoobraznii1986/dbt_workshop.git`.

Open this project in VSCode.

Option:

```bash
cd dbt_workshop
code .
```

## Install dbt and VENV

MacOS

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Windows:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/Activate.ps1
```

Install dbt for Postgress

```bash
python -m pip install dbt-core dbt-postgres
```

Create `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip freeze -l > requirements.txt
```

Check if we have dbt

```bash
dbt --version
```

## Create new dbt project

```bash
dbt init
13:55:53  Running with dbt=1.9.1
Enter a name for your project (letters, digits, underscore): dbtworkshop
13:56:14
Your new dbt project "dbtworkshop" was created!

Which database would you like to use?
[1] postgres

Enter a number: 1
host (hostname for the instance): 95.163.248.223
port [5432]:
user (dev username): user
pass (dev password):
dbname (default database that dbt will build objects in): PostgreSQL-9482
schema (default schema that dbt will build objects in): dev
threads (1 or more) [1]: 1
14:03:44  Profile dbtworkshop written to /Users/dmitryanoshin/.dbt/profiles.yml using target's profile_template.yml and your supplied values. Run 'dbt debug' to validate the connection.
```

It will create a project and Profile

```dbt
dbtworkshop:
  outputs:
    dev:
      dbname: PostgreSQL-9482
      host: 95.163.248.223
      pass: <PASSSWORD>
      port: 5432
      schema: dev
      threads: 1
      type: postgres
      user: user
  target: dev
```

We can us ENV variables to avoid putting password into profile.

Finally, we will move all content from `dbtworkshop` into the root directory.

We can test that dbt is working with `dbt

## Running sample models

We have some models already in dbt as an example.

We can try to review them:

- `models/example/my_first_dbt_model.sql` - create a kind of source model
- `models/example/my_second_dbt_model.sql` - depend on source model
- `models/example/schema.yml` - model documentation

To run these models we can just make `dbt run`

Review folder `logs`

## Build dbt model for our example

Let's delete the models and create new models for an example.

Create folder `jaffle_shop` and 3 files:

- `customer_sales.sql`


```sql
with customers as (

    select
        id as customer_id,
        first_name,
        last_name

    from jaffle_shop.customers

),

orders as (

    select
        id as order_id,
        user_id as customer_id,
        order_date,
        status

    from jaffle_shop.orders

),

customer_orders as (

    select
        customer_id,

        min(order_date) as first_order_date,
        max(order_date) as most_recent_order_date,
        count(order_id) as number_of_orders

    from orders

    group by 1

),

final as (

    select
        customers.customer_id,
        customers.first_name,
        customers.last_name,
        customer_orders.first_order_date,
        customer_orders.most_recent_order_date,
        coalesce(customer_orders.number_of_orders, 0) as number_of_orders

    from customers

    left join customer_orders using (customer_id)

)

select * from final
```

And modify the `dbt_project.yaml`

```yaml
models:
  jaffle_shop:
    +materialized: view
```

or

```sql
{{
  config(
    materialized='view'
  )
}}
```

We can delete this folder and model now.

## Adding the rest of the models in dbt style

Create folder `staging` with subfolders `jaffle_shop` and `stripe`

Add file `jaffle_shop/_jaffle_shop_sources.yml`

```yaml
version: 2

sources:
  - name: jaffle_shop
    description: Jaffle Shop
    loader: Manual
    database: PostgreSQL-9482
    schema: jaffle_shop
    tables:
      - name: customers
      - name: orders
```

## add dbt source models

`models/staging/stg_jaffle_shop__customers.sql`

```sql
select
    id as customer_id,
    first_name,
    last_name

from {{ source('jaffle_shop', 'customers') }}
```

`models/staging/stg_jaffle_shop__orders.sql`

```sql
select
    id as order_id,
    user_id as customer_id,
    order_date,
    status

from {{ source('jaffle_shop', 'orders') }}
```

Modify `dbt_projects.yml`

```yaml
staging:
      +materialized: view
      +tags: staging
```

Let's also add stripe source model in `strip` folder.

Add `stripe/_stripe_sources.yml`

```yml
version: 2

sources:
  - name: stripe
    database: PostgreSQL-9482
    schema: stripe
    tables:
      - name: payment
```

Add the model:

```sql
select
    id as payment_id,
    orderid as order_id,
    paymentmethod as payment_method,
    status,
    -- amount is stored in cents, convert it to dollars
    amount / 100 as amount,
    created as created_at
from {{ source('stripe', 'payment') }}
```

## Documentation for our new models and generic tests

Generic tests are simple:

```yaml
data_tests:
  - unique
  - not_null

data_tests:
  - accepted_values:
      values:
        - completed
        - shipped
        - returned
        - return_pending
        - placed
```

Add files:

- `models/staging/stg_jaffle_shop__customers.yml`

```yaml
version: 2

models:
  - name: stg_jaffle_shop__customers
    description: This model cleans up customer data
    columns:
      - name: customer_id
        description: Primary key
        data_tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
```

- `models/staging/stg_jaffle_shop__orders.yml`

```yml
version: 2

models:
  - name: stg_jaffle_shop__orders
    description: This model cleans up order data
    columns:
      - name: order_id
        description: Primary key
        data_tests:
        - unique
        - not_null
      - name: status
        tests:
          - accepted_values:
              values: ['placed', 'shipped', 'completed', 'return_pending', 'returned']
      - name: customer_id
        data_tests:
          - not_null
          - relationships:
              to: ref('stg_jaffle_shop__customers')
              field: customer_id
```

`models/staging/stripe/stg_stripe__payments.yml`

```yml
version: 2

models:
  - name: stg_stripe__payments
    description: Stripe payments
    columns:
      - name: payment_id
        description: Primary key
        data_tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
```

We can also add a Singular test as an example:

`tests/assert_positive_total_for_payments.sql`

```sql
-- Refunds have a negative amount, so the total amount should always be >= 0.
-- Therefore return records where this isn't true to make the test fail.
select
    order_id,
    sum(amount) as total_amount
from {{ ref('stg_stripe__payments') }}
group by 1
having sum(amount) > 0
```

As a result we have 3 models and their tests.

We can run models with

```bash
dbt run --select tag:staging
```

And test:

```bash
dbt test --select tag:staging
```

## Adding Freshness test

For source models we can add a freshness test base on specific timestamp column

```yml
version: 2

models:
  - name: stg_jaffle_shop__orders
    description: This model cleans up order data
    loaded_at_field: _etl_loaded_at
    freshness:
      warn_after: {count: 12, period: hour}
      error_after: {count: 24, period: hour}
    columns:
      - name: order_id
        description: Primary key
        tests:
        - unique
        - not_null
      - name: status
        tests:
          - accepted_values:
              values: ['placed', 'shipped', 'completed', 'return_pending', 'returned']
      - name: customer_id
        tests:
          - not_null
          - relationships:
              to: ref('stg_jaffle_shop__customers')
              field: customer_id
```

## Adding Pre-Commit

We can add Pre-Commit File to check local quality of code

Install the `pre-commit` package

```bash
pip install pre-commit
```

Create file `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

And copy paste the content

```yaml
# Pre-commit that runs locally
fail_fast: false

repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v4.6.0
    hooks:
      - id: trailing-whitespace
      - id: check-yaml

  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-prettier
    rev: v3.1.0
    hooks:
      - id: prettier
        files: '\.(yaml|yml)$'

  - repo: https://github.com/psf/black
    rev: 24.8.0
    hooks:
      - id: black
        language_version: python3.11

  - repo: https://github.com/pycqa/flake8
    rev: 7.1.1
    hooks:
      - id: flake8

  - repo: https://github.com/tconbeer/sqlfmt
    rev: v0.21.0
    hooks:
      - id: sqlfmt
        files: ^(models|analyses|tests)/.*.sql$
```

Activate pre-commit

```bash
pre-commit install
```

## Creating Pull Request

Add into the `.gitignore` folder with VENV `venv/`.

Let's create actual branch for development work (usually it starts before anything else)

```bash
git checkout -b feature/new-dbt-model
```

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Adding initial models"
```

It will test everything and commit.

We also would like to add a template for PR. Create a new folder `.github` and inside a new file `pull_request_template.md`

```yaml
# Description of change

> Eg: The new model_name_here is responsible for a_thing that relates to business_requirements.  It is doing some complex_thing (which is commented) that is required because of data_quality_issue or business_rule that is outlined in the requirements document.

# Links
  > Ticket, Slack conversations, Doc


# Testing

  > Adding dbt run, test, SQL queries


# Before Merge

  > Anything to do before merge?

---

# Diligence

- [ ] I have checked affected models for appropriate tests and metadata
- [ ] Project has been built locally
- [ ] Project has been tested locally
- [ ] Each model has YAML file with model description, tests
- [ ] dbt CI pass
```

We didn't yet merge it and it is not active, we can manually copy it.

## Adding CI step

We want to make sure same checks run in GitHub.

Let's create a GitHub Action to run it

Add new file `.github/workflows/pre-commit.yml`

```yaml
name: Run Pre-commit Hooks

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  pre-commit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Checkout the code and fetch all branches
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0 # Ensure the full history is fetched, not just the last commit

      # Set up Python environment
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: 3.11

      # Install dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m venv venv
          . venv/bin/activate
          pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          pre-commit install --install-hooks

      # Fetch the main branch to ensure it's available for comparison
      - name: Fetch main branch
        run: git fetch origin main

      # Run pre-commit on all files changed between the current branch and main
      - name: Run pre-commit on all changed files
        run: |
          . venv/bin/activate
          # Get the list of files changed between the current branch and main
          files=$(git diff --name-only origin/main)
          if [ -n "$files" ]; then
            pre-commit run --files $files
          else
            echo "No modified files to check."
          fi
```

## Adding Marts

Add new files

- `models/mart/dim_customers.sql`

```sql
with
    customers as (select * from {{ ref('stg_jaffle_shop__customers') }}),

    orders as (select * from {{ ref('stg_jaffle_shop__orders') }}),

    customer_orders as (

        select
            customer_id,

            min(order_date) as first_order_date,
            max(order_date) as most_recent_order_date,
            count(order_id) as number_of_orders

        from orders

        group by 1

    ),

    final as (

        select
            customers.customer_id,
            customers.first_name,
            customers.last_name,
            customer_orders.first_order_date,
            customer_orders.most_recent_order_date,
            coalesce(customer_orders.number_of_orders, 0) as number_of_orders

        from customers

        left join customer_orders using (customer_id)

    )

select *
from final
```

- `models/mart/fct_orders.sql`

```sql
with
    orders as (select * from {{ ref ('stg_jaffle_shop__orders' ) }}),

    payments as (select * from {{ ref ('stg_stripe__payments') }}),

    order_payments as (
        select order_id, sum(case when status = 'success' then amount end) as amount

        from payments
        group by 1
    ),

    final as (

        select
            orders.order_id,
            orders.customer_id,
            orders.order_date,
            coalesce(order_payments.amount, 0) as amount

        from orders
        left join order_payments using (order_id)
    )

select *
from final
```

And lets add documentation for them

- `models/mart/dim_customers.yml`

```yml
version: 2

models:
  - name: dim_customers
    description: "Aggregates customer information with their order statistics."

    columns:
      - name: customer_id
        description: "Unique identifier for each customer."
        data_tests:
          - unique
          - not_null

      - name: first_name
        description: "Customer's first name."

      - name: last_name
        description: "Customer's last name."

      - name: first_order_date
        description: "The date of the customer's first order."

      - name: most_recent_order_date
        description: "The date of the customer's most recent order."

      - name: number_of_orders
        description: "The total number of orders placed by the customer."
```

- `models/mart/fct_orders.yml`

```yml
version: 2

models:
  - name: fct_orders
    description: "Combines order and payment information, summarizing successful payment amounts for each order."
    columns:
      - name: order_id
        description: "Unique identifier for each order."
        data_tests:
          - not_null
      - name: customer_id
        description: "Unique identifier for the customer who placed the order."
        data_tests:
          - not_null
      - name: order_date
        description: "The date when the order was placed."
        data_tests:
          - not_null
      - name: amount
        description: "The total amount of successful payments for the order. Defaults to 0 if no successful payments exist."
    data_tests:
      - dbt_utils.unique_combination_of_columns:
          combination_of_columns:
            - order_id
            - customer_id
            - order_date

```

We leveraged dbt package: `dbt_utils` and we need to add package and install.

Add file `packages.yml`

```yaml
packages:
  - package: dbt-labs/dbt_utils
    version: 1.3.0
  - package: calogica/dbt_expectations
    version: 0.10.4
  - package: calogica/dbt_date
    version: 0.10.1
```
And install packages

```bash
dbt deps
```

We also need to update `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
models:
  dbtworkshop:
    # Config indicated by + and applies to all files under models/example/
    staging:
      +materialized: view
      +tags: staging
    mart:
      +materialized: view
      +tags: mart
```

We can run the models

```bash
dbt build --select tag:mart
```

## How to control profiles

When we run dbt we can specify `target` env and `profile` path.

```bash
dbt build --select fct_orders --target dev --profiles-dir ~/.dbt/
```

## Adding macro with ETL timestamp

Add file with macro `macros/add_etl_timestamp.sql`

```sql
{% macro add_etl_timestamp() %}
    CURRENT_TIMESTAMP as etl_timestamp_utc
{% endmacro %}
```

We need to add documentation:

```yml
version: 2

macros:
  - name: add_etl_timestamp
    description: |
      This macro generates a UTC timestamp representing the current date and time when executed.
      It is useful for tracking ETL processes by adding a standardized `etl_timestamp_utc` column
      in transformation queries.
    arguments: []
```

And we can add this marco into existing models:

```sql
select id as customer_id, first_name, last_name, {{ add_etl_timestamp() }}
from {{ source('jaffle_shop', 'customers') }}
```

## Adding CI step for dbt

We can enforce quality of dbt models but running additional checks for YAML files.

Let's modify the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` by adding:

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/dbt-checkpoint/dbt-checkpoint
    rev: v2.0.4
    hooks:
      - id: check-model-has-description
      - id: check-model-has-tests-by-group
        args: ["--tests", "not_null", "--test-cnt", "1", "--"]
      - id: check-model-has-tests-by-group
        args:
          [
            "--tests",
            "unique",
            "unique_combination_of_columns",
            "--test-cnt",
            "1",
            "--",
          ]

      - id: check-macro-has-description
        files: ^(macros/).*$
```

```bash
pre-commit install
```

Commit files

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Adding files"
```

It will ask to add `not_null` tests into `models/mart/fct_orders.yml`.

## Checking the dbt docs

```bash
 dbt docs generate
 dbt docs serve --host localhost --port 8091
 ```

 Open in browser `http://localhost:8091/#!/overview`.

## Running dbt check in CI

We need to update our GitHub actions to run dbt checks because it will require to run dbt and connect database.

DBT checkpoint is checking the dbt artifacts, we should make sure it can run and compile dbt.

For this we will add new profile `profiles.yaml`


```yaml
default:
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: postgres
      host: '{{ env_var("DBT_HOST") }}'
      user: '{{ env_var("DBT_USER") }}'
      password: '{{ env_var("DBT_PASSWORD") }}'
      port: 5432
      dbname: '{{ env_var("DBT_DATABASE") }}'
      schema: dev
  target: dev
```

In GitHub we can assign values for these env variables in GitHub Repository -> Settings.

We can modify our GitHub Actions to include the `dbt complie` part:

```yaml
name: Run Pre-commit Hooks with Postgres

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  pre-commit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Checkout the code
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      # Set up Python environment
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: 3.11

      # Install dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m venv venv
          . venv/bin/activate
          pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      # Install dbt package dependencies
      - name: Install dbt package dependencies
        run: |
          . venv/bin/activate
          dbt deps

      # Copy the profiles.yml file to the correct location

To make is pass, lets delete the singular test.

## Running dbt models in Staging env

We can also add one more step to run dbt models in another Schema `CI`.

Let's add the schema CI into Postgres

```sql
create schema if not exists ci;
```

We should add one more profile:

```yaml
dbtworkshop:
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: postgres
      host: '{{ env_var("DBT_HOST") }}'
      user: '{{ env_var("DBT_USER") }}'
      password: '{{ env_var("DBT_PASSWORD") }}'
      port: 5432
      dbname: '{{ env_var("DBT_DATABASE") }}'
      schema: dev
    ci:
      type: postgres
      host: '{{ env_var("DBT_HOST") }}'
      user: '{{ env_var("DBT_USER") }}'
      password: '{{ env_var("DBT_PASSWORD") }}'
      port: 5432
      dbname: '{{ env_var("DBT_DATABASE") }}'
      schema: ci_schema

  target: dev
```
